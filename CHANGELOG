# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Note that
0.x versions may be breaking, per the semver standard.

## Unreleased

* Exclude unnecessary build-time files and dependencies from the vendored cookbook
* Update build dependencies and build against Chef 12 and Chef 13

## 1.0.0 (2017-02-24)

* [BREAKING] Remove the default prepare_deploy and complete_deploy recipes - these
  were only being used to verify the path was set and the new helper does that
  better.
* [BREAKING] Current release path is no longer set in node.deploy.release_path -
  instead you must use `this_release_path` which will throw if it hasn't been
  set (because deployment hasn't happened yet) when called.
* [BREAKING] No longer attempts to automatically install composer packages for
  a prepare_deploy - do this in your project if you need it.

## 0.1.0 (2017-02-24)

* First tagged release
